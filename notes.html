<p>This is a place for me to put notes that I have written up about various topics. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or corrections,
I would love to hear them, just send me an email (or tell me in person).</p>

<big><b>Expository Notes</b></big>

<p><a href="notes/wu.pdf"><b>Steenrod Squares, Wu Classes, and Stiefel-Whitney Classes</b></a>. There is a list of formulae for the first five Wu 
classes in terms of Stiefel-Whitney classes on nLab. There was no reference given for the necessary computations, so I tried to do them myself. In 
doing so, I realised I misunderstood what little I thought I knew about Steenrod squares and Wu classes. In this note I explain what is needed to 
compute, and hopefully understand, the formulae given on nLab. <!--https://mathoverflow.net/a/308478/21564

<p><a href="notes/hilton.pdf"><b>Homotopy Groups of a Wedge Sum of Spheres</b></a>. There is a trick for computing the first few homotopy groups of a 
wedge sum of spheres which uses cellular approximation. But how do you compute the remaining homotopy groups? The answer is given by Hilton's 
Theorem. After introducing the trick, I explain Hilton's theorem and how to implement it to calculate the homotopy groups of a wedge sum of spheres 
in terms of the homotopy groups of spheres.</p> <!-- https://mathoverflow.net/q/436789/21564 -->

<p><a href="notes/chi_y.pdf"><b>The Hirzebruch &chi;<sub>y</sub> Genus and a Theorem of Hirzebruch on Almost Complex Manifolds</b></a>. The purpose 
of this note is to give an introduction to the Hirzebruch &chi;<sub>y</sub> genus and to give a proof of a theorem of Hirzebruch which states that 
on a closed almost complex manifold M of dimension 4m we have &chi;(M) &equiv; (-1)<sup>m</sup>&sigma;(M) mod 4.

<p><i>A modified version of this note appears as an appendix to a paper; see <a href="research.html#biquotient">here</a>.</i></p>

<p><a href="notes/grass_spin.pdf"><b>Which Grassmannians are Spin/Spin<sup>c</sup>?</b></a> The purpose of this note is to determine which 
(unoriented, oriented, and complex) grassmannians are spin, and which ones are spin<sup>c</sup>. In order to achieve this goal, formulae for the 
first and second Stiefel-Whitney classes of a tensor product are derived. The corresponding non-orientable analogues pin<sup>+</sup>, 
pin<sup>-</sup>, and pin<sup>c</sup> are also considered.

<p><a href="notes/sphere_bundle.pdf"><b>The Normal Bundle of a Sphere Bundle is Trivial</b></a>. Given a Riemannian metric on a smooth vector bundle 
E &#8594; M, one can form its sphere bundle S(E). The purpose of this note is to show that the normal bundle of the inclusion of total spaces 
S(E) &#8594; E is trivial. <!-- Thanks to Andrew Trolio for encouraging me to upload this.

<big><b>Notes for Talks and Lectures</big></b>

<p><i>I plan to improve all of these at some point.</i></p>

<p><a href="notes/ac_obs.pdf"><b>Almost Complex Structures and Obstruction Theory</b></a>. These are notes for a lecture I gave in John Morgan's 
Homotopy Theory course at Stony Brook in Fall 2018.</p>
